# 2020-Nagorno-Karabakh-War

### **Backstory**
---
The 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war was an armed conflict in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding territories. The main combatants were Azerbaijan, with support from Turkey and foreign mercenary groups, on one side and the self-proclaimed Republic of Artsakh and Armenia on the other side.

### **About**
---
This repo contains a brief demographics analysis of the causalities during the second Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. I was interested to see who are the real victims of the clashing geo-political interests. The brief analysis illustrated that the majority of deceased solders were conscripts under 20.
